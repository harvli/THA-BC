### Hi there! My name is Harvey and I'm passionate Software Engineer. I hope you will enjoy taking a lot at my take home assessment as much as I enjoyed developing it!
<br/>
Here are the short and easy steps to get the application up and running:

```
Fork and clone this repo
```

</br>
<br/>
## Install the dependencies with this command in your terminal in the directory of this repo:

```
npm i
```

</br>
<br/>
Add a process.env file in the root directory of the cloned repo. Contents of process.env file should look like this, for example:

```
PGURI = postgres://yourpostgresstringURI
```

</br>
<br/>
Finally, to get your application up and running, run this command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

</br>
And there you have it! Easy like I said, enjoy and thanks!
